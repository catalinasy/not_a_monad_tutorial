This time I decided to do something uncommon. I have asked Martina Cantaro, a psychologist that works for our company Lambdaclass, to write about the work she is doing training young developers. I hope you find it useful.

This time I’ve interviewed Brad Chamberlain about Chapel, a productive parallel programming language.

I did so because I wanted to have more freedom in choosing the type of projects and team I work with.
That is why today it is a very special day for me. We take a break from regular interviews and celebrate the release of our first open source application: Holiday Ping.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/lasp-a-little-further-down-the-erlang-rabbithole/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2017-05-09 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>May 9, 2017</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Lasp, a little further down the Erlang rabbithole</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>A few years ago I found Lasp: “a suite of libraries aimed at providing a comprehensive programming system for planetary scale Elixir and Erlang applications”. At this point it should come as no surprise for you to learn that here at Not a Monad Tutorial we are are interested in distributed systems and Erlang. After playing a little bit with Lasp I watched a few talks by its creator: Christopher Meiklejohn.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/the-big-old-reliable-elephant-talking-about-postgres-with-craig-kerstiens/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2017-04-26 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>April 26, 2017</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>The big old reliable elephant, talking about Postgres with Craig Kerstiens</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>In this opportunity I interviewed Craig Kerstiens. Craig works for citusdata, a company that helps customers scale databases beyond a single node. Over the last few years, after building systems that used Redis, Cassandra, Riak, Elasticsearch and even Mongo, I rediscovered my love for PostgreSQL. The documentation is excellent, its development pace is astonishing and it is a good old reliable beast. However its feature set can be quite overwhelming. To mention just a few of its special features: you got a big option of index types (B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN and BRIN), many data types, extensions, window functions, common table expressions, foreign data wrappers.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/gaming-with-elixir-discovering-new-lands-in-the-beam-realm/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2017-04-20 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>April 20, 2017</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Gaming with Elixir, discoverting new lands in the BEAM realm</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>In this opportunity I interviewed somebody I don’t normally interview: a client, Chris Jimison, CTO of Merigo. One of my clients. After working for almost a year with Merigo, I appreciate and understand the differences between using a BEAM language to develop a typical REST JSON system and using it to develop a videogame backend. I am not aware of many companies using Elixir to develop backends. I have only watch a talk by Jamie Winsor called “Building And Releasing A Massively Multiplayer Online Game”.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/a-pythonist-finds-a-new-home-at-clojure-land/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2017-04-14 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>April 14, 2017</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>A Pythonist finds a new home at Clojure land</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Welcome back to another interview of Not a Monad Tutorial. In this opportunity I decided to interview Facundo Olano, a friend, a teammate, and a developer with a diverse experience. We talked about Python, Node.js, Clojure, Common Lisp and software development in general. Something worth mentioning is that this is not the first time Python and Clojure get mentioned together at Not a Monad Tutorial. Timothy Baldridge implemented Pixie, a Lisp language inspired by Clojure, in Python.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/interview-with-jesper-louis-andersen-about-erlang-haskell-ocaml-go-idris-the-jvm-software-and-protocol-design-part-ii/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-12-29 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>December 29, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Interview with Jesper Louis Andersen about Erlang, Haskell, OCaml, Go, Idris, the JVM software and protocol design - PART II</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>This is part II of the interview with Jesper Louis Andersen. You can read part I here. This part of the interview is mostly about Erlang, one of my favorite languages. If you want to learn Erlang, take a look at Spawned Shelter, a website I made for Erlang newcomers.

His blog (you should also check his old blog, you will find a lot of good things over there) and code (specially things like safetyvalve and fuse) have been a big inspiration to me. That is why I published the interview in two parts: I had too many questions for him. I hope you enjoy reading his answers as much as I did.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/efene-an-erlang-vm-language-that-embraces-the-zen-of-python/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-11-27 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>November 27, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Efene, an Erlang VM language that embraces the Zen of Python</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>In this ocasion we interviewed Mariano Guerra, creator of Efene.

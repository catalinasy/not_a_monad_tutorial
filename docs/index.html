                                        <p>unbalancedparentheses
                                            I was always interested in economics. However until a few years ago I never
                                            really studied finance. Since I decided to change that, I have learnt
                                            finance from reading good and bad books, online courses, newspapers, blog
                                            posts and online forums and by executing trades. This post sums up and
                                            prioritizes the roadmap I recommend taking to learn about finance. Having a
                                            deep understanding of macroeconomics is not necessary to learn about
                                            finance, even less if you are only looking to manage your own money.</p>

                                        <p>Like our previous interviewee Osvaldo Martin is one of the developers of
                                            PyMC3 and ArviZ. He is a researcher specialized in Bayesian statistics and
                                            data science. He will be speaking at our BuzzConf this year. I hope you like
                                            this interview as much as we did!

                                            probabilistic programming</h1>
                                        <div class=catalogue-line></div>
                                        <p>&gt;“A colleague of von Neumann and Ulam, Nicholas Metropolis, suggested
                                            using the name Monte Carlo, which refers to the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco
                                            where Ulam’s uncle would borrow money from relatives to gamble”
                                            After studying and working with distributed systems my interests drifted
                                            into data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and now
                                            statistics. After a while I found I really liked applying what I have learnt
                                            into finance. That is how I learnt about probabilistic programming and PyMC
                                            while reading Thomas Wiecki posts at Quantopian blog.</p>

                                        <p>At LambdaClass and our blog This is not a Monad tutorial we are a big fans of
                                            exploring new topics, different operating systems, platforms, languages and
                                            libraries/frameworks. We have been talking in our company about exploring
                                            new subjects like protocols.
                                            There is a whole generation of developers that has only worked with HTTP,
                                            ReST and JSON. While a partial improvement over previous technologies, it
                                            has created a protocol monoculture. There are situations where other
                                            protocols are better suited but many of the young bloods don’t even know
                                            they exist.</p>

                                            This time I decided to do something uncommon. I have asked Martina Cantaro,
                                            a psychologist that works for our company Lambdaclass, to write about the
                                            work she is doing training young developers. I hope you find it useful.

                                            (HPC) so I decided to get out from my comfort area. This time I’ve

                                            years ago I started my own company LambdaClass. I did so because I wanted to
                                            have more freedom in choosing the type of projects and team I work with.
                                            That is why today it is a very special day for me. We take a break from
                                            regular interviews and celebrate the release of our first open source

                                        <p>A few years ago I found Lasp: “a suite of libraries aimed at providing a
                                            comprehensive programming system for planetary scale Elixir and Erlang
                                            applications”. At this point it should come as no surprise for you to learn
                                            that here at Not a Monad Tutorial we are are interested in distributed
                                            systems and Erlang. After playing a little bit with Lasp I watched a few
                                            talks by its creator: Christopher Meiklejohn.</p>

                                        <p>In this opportunity I interviewed Craig Kerstiens. Craig works for citusdata,
                                            a company that helps customers scale databases beyond a single node. Over
                                            the last few years, after building systems that used Redis, Cassandra, Riak,
                                            Elasticsearch and even Mongo, I rediscovered my love for PostgreSQL. The
                                            documentation is excellent, its development pace is astonishing and it is a
                                            good old reliable beast. However its feature set can be quite overwhelming.
                                            To mention just a few of its special features: you got a big option of index
                                            types (B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN and BRIN), many data types,
                                            extensions, window functions, common table expressions, foreign data
                                            wrappers.</p>

                                        <p>In this opportunity I interviewed somebody I don’t normally interview: a
                                            client, Chris Jimison, CTO of Merigo. One of my clients. After working for
                                            almost a year with Merigo, I appreciate and understand the differences
                                            between using a BEAM language to develop a typical REST JSON system and
                                            using it to develop a videogame backend. I am not aware of many companies
                                            using Elixir to develop backends. I have only watch a talk by Jamie Winsor
                                            called “Building And Releasing A Massively Multiplayer Online Game”.</p>

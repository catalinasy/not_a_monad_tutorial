March 7, 2019</div><p class=summary>I was always interested in economics. However until a few years ago I never really studied finance. Since I decided to change that, I have learnt finance from reading good and bad books, online courses, newspapers, blog posts and online forums and by executing trades. This post sums up and prioritizes the roadmap I recommend taking to learn about finance. Having a deep understanding of macroeconomics is not necessary to learn about finance, even less if you are only looking to manage your own money.</p><p class=continue_reading><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/how-to-earn-your-macroeconomics-and-finance-white-belt-as-a-software-developer/>Continue Reading</a></p></div><div class=item_wrapper><div class=date>Feb 2019</div><p class=title>Interview with Osvaldo Martin about Bayesian Analysis with Python</p><div class=details><span>posted on</span>
February 11, 2019</div><p class=summary>Like our previous interviewee Osvaldo Martin is one of the developers of PyMC3 and ArviZ. He is a researcher specialized in Bayesian statistics and data science. He will be speaking at our BuzzConf this year. I hope you like this interview as much as we did!

After studying and working with distributed systems my interests drifted into data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and now statistics. After a while I found I really liked applying what I have learnt into finance. That is how I learnt about probabilistic programming and PyMC while reading Thomas Wiecki posts at Quantopian blog.</p><p class=continue_reading><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/interview-with-thomas-wiecki-about-pymc-and-probabilistic-programming/>Continue Reading</a></p></div><div class=item_wrapper><div class=date>Sep 2018</div><p class=title>There&#39;s more to life than HTTP, VerneMQ a high-performance and distributed MQTT broker</p><div class=details><span>posted on</span>

There is a whole generation of developers that has only worked with HTTP, ReST and JSON. While a partial improvement over previous technologies, it has created a protocol monoculture. There are situations where other protocols are better suited but many of the young bloods don’t even know they exist.</p><p class=continue_reading><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/theres-more-to-life-than-htt/>Continue Reading</a></p></div><div class=item_wrapper><div class=date>Aug 2018</div><p class=title>How to pretend you have social skills</p><div class=details><span>posted on</span>

At this point it should come as no surprise for you to learn that here at Not a Monad Tutorial we are are interested in distributed systems and Erlang.

April 26, 2017</div><p class=summary>In this opportunity I interviewed Craig Kerstiens. Craig works for citusdata, a company that helps customers scale databases beyond a single node. Over the last few years, after building systems that used Redis, Cassandra, Riak, Elasticsearch and even Mongo, I rediscovered my love for PostgreSQL. The documentation is excellent, its development pace is astonishing and it is a good old reliable beast. However its feature set can be quite overwhelming. To mention just a few of its special features: you got a big option of index types (B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN and BRIN), many data types, extensions, window functions, common table expressions, foreign data wrappers.</p><p class=continue_reading><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/the-big-old-reliable-elephant-talking-about-postgres-with-craig-kerstiens/>Continue Reading</a></p></div><div class=item_wrapper><div class=date>Apr 2017</div><p class=title>Gaming with Elixir, discoverting new lands in the BEAM realm</p><div class=details><span>posted on</span>

In this opportunity I decided to interview Facundo Olano, a friend, a teammate, and a developer with a diverse experience. We talked about Python, Node.js, Clojure, Common Lisp and software development in general. Something worth mentioning is that this is not the first time Python and Clojure get mentioned together at Not a Monad Tutorial. Timothy Baldridge implemented Pixie, a Lisp language inspired by Clojure, in Python.</p><p class=continue_reading><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/a-pythonist-finds-a-new-home-at-clojure-land/>Continue Reading</a></p></div><div class=item_wrapper><div class=date>Dec 2015</div><p class=title>Interview with Jesper Louis Andersen about Erlang, Haskell, OCaml, Go, Idris, the JVM software and protocol design - PART II</p><div class=details><span>posted on</span>

September 6, 2015</div><p class=summary>I tend to think that if I do not know how to implement something then I do not undestand completely how it works. That is why I want to learn so many things: new frameworks, programming languages, garbage collectors, type systems, compilers, editors, operating systems, protocols, kernel development. The road to enlightenment is long and difficult. To make things worse, you need to invest time on keeping up to date with technologies you thought you already knew.</p><p class=continue_reading><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/how-to-earn-your-clojure-white-belt/>Continue Reading</a></p></div><div class=item_wrapper><div class=date>Aug 2015</div><p class=title>Interview with Nenad Rakocevic about Red, a Rebol inspired programming language</p><div class=details><span>posted on</span>

From my completely subjective point of view Red and Rebol are quite strange creatures! But don’t get me wrong, that doesn’t mean something bad. For example, I am not aware of many high-level languages which features an embedded DSL for general-purpose low-level programming or that have 50 native types.</p><p class=continue_reading><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/interview-with-nenad-rakocevic-about-red-a-rebol-inspired-programming-language/>Continue Reading</a></p></div><div class=item_wrapper><div class=date>Aug 2015</div><p class=title>Interview with Brian McKenna about Roy, Purescript, Haskell, Idris and dependent types</p><div class=details><span>posted on</span>

_“This experience lead me to focus on building Kafka to combine what we had seen in messaging systems with the log concept popular in databases and distributed system internals.

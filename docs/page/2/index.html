After studying and working with distributed systems my interests drifted into data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and now statistics. After a while I found I really liked applying what I have learnt into finance. That is how I learnt about probabilistic programming and PyMC while reading Thomas Wiecki posts at Quantopian blog.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/mlfe-ml-landing-in-the-erlang-world/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-11-15 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>November 15, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>MLFE, ML landing in the Erlang world</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Time has passed since our last interview for This is not a Monad Tutorial.

That is why I want to learn so many things: new frameworks, programming languages, garbage collectors, type systems, compilers, editors, operating systems, protocols, kernel development. The road to enlightenment is long and difficult. To make things worse, you need to invest time on keeping up to date with technologies you thought you already knew.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/interview-with-nenad-rakocevic-about-red-a-rebol-inspired-programming-language/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-08-28 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>August 28, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Interview with Nenad Rakocevic about Red, a Rebol inspired programming language</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>After our last interview with Brian McKenna for This is not a Monad tutorial we interviewed Nenad Rakocevic, creator of the Red programming language.
From my completely subjective point of view Red and Rebol are quite strange creatures! But don’t get me wrong, that doesn’t mean something bad. For example, I am not aware of many high-level languages which features an embedded DSL for general-purpose low-level programming or that have 50 native types.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/interview-with-brian-mckenna-about-roy-purescript-haskell-idris-and-dependent-types/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-08-26 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>August 26, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Interview with Brian McKenna about Roy, Purescript, Haskell, Idris and dependent types</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>As promised in our last interview for This is not a Monad tutorial we interviewed Brian McKenna, creator of the Roy programming language.

I was always interested in economics. However until a few years ago I never really studied finance. Since I decided to change that, I have learnt finance from reading good and bad books, online courses, newspapers, blog posts and online forums and by executing trades. This post sums up and prioritizes the roadmap I recommend taking to learn about finance. Having a deep understanding of macroeconomics is not necessary to learn about finance, even less if you are only looking to manage your own money.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/interview-with-jay-kreps-about-apache-kafka/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-02-22 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>February 22, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Interview with Jay Kreps about Apache Kafka</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>This time we interviewed Jay Kreps, one of the creators of Apache Kafka. Kafka is an open source messaging system with a few design choices that make it particulary useful for high throughput and low latency scenarios.
_“This experience lead me to focus on building Kafka to combine what we had seen in messaging systems with the log concept popular in databases and distributed system internals. We wanted something to act as a central pipeline first for all activity data, and eventually for many other uses, including data deployment out of Hadoop, monitoring data, etc.</p></div></a><a href=https://notamonadtutorial.com/docs/interview_with_osvaldo_martin/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-02-11 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>February 11, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Interview with Osvaldo Martin about Bayesian Analysis with Python</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Like our previous interviewee Osvaldo Martin is one of the developers of PyMC3 and ArviZ.
